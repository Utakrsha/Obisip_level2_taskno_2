    General Bipin Rawat was the first CDS of India who was killed in an IAF chopper Mi-17V5 crash on 8 December 2021 in Tamil Nadu's Coonoor, along with his wife Madhulika Rawat and staff. 13 out of the 14 members aboard the chopper have been declared dead. The Indian Army has positively identified CDS Rawat, his wife, and Brig Lidder who were laid to rest on 10 December 2021. The remaining 10 bodies will be kept in the mortuary of the Army Base Hospital till positive identification is completed. A tri-service inquiry led by Air Chief Marshal Manavendra Singh has been ordered into the case and the black box has been retrieved. At this sad unfortunate moment, take a look at the life of CDS Bipin Rawat.
